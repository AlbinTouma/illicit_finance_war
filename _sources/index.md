# Foreword

Welcome to **Illicit financial flows and war for investigators**, a collection of investigations on illicit financial flows and the business networks behind war and war crimes.

My goals are 

1. Document how illicit funds are used as a foreign policy tool 
2. Identify the networks and illicit funds behind war crimes 
3. Shed light on policy discussions surrounding sanctions and anti-money laundering with the goal of making recommendations. 

My investigations range from literature reviews and case studies to OSINT investigations and data analysis. Illicit financial flows and war is written as an interactive jupyter-book. 

## Authors

Some about myself, Albin Touma. 

My background is in research and data analysis. As an International Affairs Research Analyst at Comply Advantage, I've helped build the screening platforms that compliance officers use. I was first motivated by the challenge of collecting data and built a global database of sanctioned entites and politically exposed persons, [Know Your Sanctions](https://knowyoursanctions.com). 

This side project quickly grew into different research projects on how illicit funds are used. In light of Russia's resource grab in Ukraine, I joined [OSINT for Ukraine](https://www.osintforukraine.com/) as an investigator documenting war crimes with a focus on illicit funds. 

I decided to write "Illicit funds and war" as a way to collate investigations and share them with a broad audience of readers.
