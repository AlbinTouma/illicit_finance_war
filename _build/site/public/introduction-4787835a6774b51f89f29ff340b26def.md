# Introduction

War pays and profiteers of war rarerly pay for their crimes. In war, the line between military victories and profit blurs where business and military networks overlap. Financial crime encourages war itself or as one lawyer in the Democratic Republic of Congo observed, 'the lack of prosecution in the area of financial crime encourages war crimes and war itself.'

How businesses were complicit in the Holocaust reminds us of the relationship between financial crime and war. About 500,000 Jews died as forced laborers. One of the largest German corporations, I.G. Farben, managed a synthetic fuel and rubber factory close to Auschwitz that employed 35,000 prisoners, mostly Jewish. Hugo Scheider used 25,000 Jews as forced labourers at their ammunition plant in Poland, some four-fifths died. Degussa produced Zyklon B while Topf & Sohne manufactured the ovens used at the concentration camps. 


Individuals and companies are rarely convicted for the part they play in war, though there is precedence. In the 1948 Nuremburg Trials, executives from the German chemical company, IG Farben, were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their role in the production of Zyklon B.

The indictment filed on May 3, 1948, named 24 defendants, all in the IG Farben industrial concerns. They were inidcted on five counts ranging from waging war of aggression to crimes against humanity and peace.

The issue of illicit financial flows and war crimes have only become more important since
Russian actors began extracting resources from Ukraine. 

Much of the focus on illicit financial flows often falls on the "dirty" side of dirty money. It is known to the public that kleptocrats and oligarchs use offshore tax havens and shell companies to hide wealth. Less known are the reasons why London remains the dirty money capital of the world or why Delaware is the largest secrecy jurisdiction in the world. 

Though debates surrounding privacy and public beneficial ownership registries
are public, they are not public knoweldge. In the same way that policy debates
are overlooked, so too is the role of the state in facilitating illicit
financial flows, which remains overlooked compared to the study of how illicit
financial flows against the backdrop of corruption harm global development. 

While working on the screening platforms that compliance officers use to uphold
sanctions and screen for risks, I became interested in how effective sanctions
and AML practices are in preventing state actors from using illicit
financial flows as a foreign policy tool. As part of my research, and in light of Russia's resource grab in Ukraine, I joined [OSINT for Ukraine](https://www.osintforukraine.com/) as an investigator. My focus is on documenting war crimes and Russia's use of illicit funds.
