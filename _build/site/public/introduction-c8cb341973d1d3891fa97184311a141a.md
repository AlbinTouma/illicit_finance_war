War pays and when the line between military networks and business blurs, so too does the line between victories and profit blur. That profiteers of war rarely pay for their cimes is an open secret with devestating consequences as one lawyer in the Democratic Republic of Congo observed, 'the lack of prosecution in the area of financial crime encourages war crimes and war itself.'

Convictions are rare but not unheard of. In the 1948 Nuremburg Trials, executives from the German chemical company, IG Farben, were indicted on five counts and executed for their use role in the production of Zyklon B. 

With Nuremburg, it was established that agents of a state could be convicted. The court, however, did not try companies. Its statutes stipulated that only individuals should be tried, not entities, and if corporatins have criminal liability remains unsettled.

The trials also serve as a warning of how hard it is to try and convict businessmen. Most businessmen complicit in the Third Reich were never tried. Ernst-Wolfgan maintained to his death that the ovens they had produced at Topf and Sons for Auschwitz, Dachau, and Buchenwald had been misused by the Nazis. Only his brother's business partner, Kurt Prufer was sentenced, in his case, by the Soviets. He died in prison. 

In the decades following Nuremberg, the focus during the Cold War was largely on the role of businessmen as inventors or producers. The defense industry became subject of reserach and public debate remains largely focused on Eisenhower's warning of the Military Industrial Complex and the expansion and size of government. 

The end of the Cold War and 9/11 gave rise to new trends in conflict and governance. Civil wars, the global war on terror, and the use of asymmetrical warfare shifted the discussion away from the defense industry to the role of businesses in conflicts. Blood diamond conflicts raised concerns about the role of businesses and exploitation in conflict zones as did the use of the infamous Blackwater contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.  

The issue of illicit financial flows and war crimes has only beco:me more important since Russian actors began extracting resources from Ukraine. 

## Why? 

Much of the focus on illicit financial flows often falls on the "dirty" side of dirty money. It is known to the public that kleptocrats and oligarchs use offshore tax havens and shell companies to hide wealth. Less known are the reasons why London remains the dirty money capital of the world or why Delaware is the largest secrecy jurisdiction in the world. 

Though debates surrounding privacy and public beneficial ownership registries are public, they are not public knoweldge. In the same way that policy debates are overlooked, so too is the role of the state in facilitating illicit financial flows, which remains overlooked compared to the study of how illicit financial flows against the backdrop of corruption harm global development.
