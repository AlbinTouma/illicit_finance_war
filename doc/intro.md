# Introduction

War pays and when the line between military networks and business blurs, so too does the line between victories and profit blur. That profiteers of war rarely pay for their cimes is an open secret with devestating consequences as one lawyer in the Democratic Republic of Congo observed: "..the lack of prosecution in the area of financial crime encourages war crimes and war itself."

Convictions are rare but not unheard of in history. During the 1948 Nuremburg Trials, executives from the German chemical company, IG Farben, were indicted on five counts and sentenced to die by hanging for their role in the production of Zyklon B. 

Nuremburg established that agents of a state could be convicted, but not whether companies could be tried. The court's statutes limited prosecution to individuals, and even though the court had the right to prosecute individual businessmen, few of the Third Reich's executives were ever put on trial. Many maintained their innocence, like Ernst-Wolfgan, who maintained until his death that the ovens his business, Topf and Sons made for Auschwitz had been 'misused'.

The legacy of the Nuremberg trials evokes mixed emotions. On the one hand, the trial of the executives of IG Farben set precedence for prosecuting businessmen of war crimes while on the other hand, Ernst-Wolfgan is part of rule that businessmen and businesses are not held accountable. 

Much of the focus on illicit financial flows often falls on the "dirty" side of dirty money. It is known to the public that kleptocrats and oligarchs use offshore tax havens and shell companies to hide wealth. Less known are the reasons why London remains the dirty money capital of the world or why Delaware is the largest secrecy jurisdiction in the world. 

Though debates surrounding privacy and public beneficial ownership registries are public, they are not public knoweldge. In the same way that policy debates are overlooked, so too is the role of the state in facilitating illicit financial flows, which remains overlooked compared to the study of how illicit financial flows against the backdrop of corruption harm global development.
